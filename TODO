1) do all the stuff with dependencies in META-INF,
   so jar's can be run without problems:
     - kick off all unnecessary libs from classpath in META-INF
     - leave only the needed ones and give them "lib/" prefix 

2) sth wrong with appWindow - it appears after a few pressed "Ctrl-D"
   and shows all the time, not disappear after 4 sec

3) add *.sh files to project and to build.xml file

4) something wrong with config.xml file. it is not created or
   created.. somewhere?

5) add log4j
